# Sphere project layout

## About

`Sphere` is a server scaffolding that uses `ent` as the database structure definition and `proto` as the interface definition. It also provides a series of code and document generation tools, including `proto` files, `Swagger` documents, `TypeScript` clients, etc.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a new project with `sphere-cli`

Use `sphere-cli` to create the project, you are free to modify the project structure subsequently. `sphere` just
provides a template, and you are free to modify the project structure according to your own needs. This way you can
freely develop your own projects without relying on any framework.

```bash
go install github.com/TBXark/sphere/cmd/sphere-cli@latest
sphere-cli create --name myproject --mod github.com/TBXark/myproject
```


### 2. Define the database structure

You can define the database structure in the `/internal/database/ent/schema` directory. For details, please refer to the [ent documentation](https://entgo.io/docs/getting-started).

When you have finished defining the database structure, you can run the following command to generate the database structure code and proto files.

```bash
make gen/db
```


### 3. Define the http server interface

You can define the http server interface in the `/proto` directory. For details, please refer to the [proto documentation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3).

When you have finished defining the http server interface, For details, please refer to
the [Transcoding HTTP/JSON to gRPC](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/transcoding)

You can run the following command to generate the http server code and swagger docs.

```bash
make gen/docs
```

There are some rules for defining the http server interface:

1. If it is a GET/DELETE request, the non-path field in the request message will be treated as a query parameter.
2. For other requests, the non-path field in the request message will be treated as a body parameter, unless `@sphere:uri` is added in the message, in which case it will be treated as a path parameter. Or `@sphere:form` is added in the message, in which case it will be treated as a query parameter.
3. It is not recommended to use pattern matching in the path parameter, such as `/api/test/{path_test1:.*}`, because it will cause routing conflicts. It is also not recommended to use pattern matching in the body parameter, such as `field_test1: .*`, because it will cause parameter parsing errors.

You can view an example of the standard HTTP server interface definition in [test.proto](./proto/shared/v1/test.proto).

### 4. Implement the business logic

You can implement the business logic in the `/internal` directory. And bind the business logic to the http server.


### 5. Start the server

Add entry in `cmd` directory, You can use `wire` to inject dependencies. For details, please refer to the [wire documentation](https://github.com/google/wire)
